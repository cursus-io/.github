<h1> Building an ecosystem for messaging & data pipelines </h1>

<p>

[cursus-io](https://github.com/cursus-io/cursus-io) is developing a growing ecosystem of tools centered around lightweight, high-performance messaging infrastructure. 

Starting with cursus, we're expanding to include connectors and utilities that enable robust event streaming and data integration across diverse environments.

**The Ecosystem**:
- [cursus](https://github.com/cursus-io/cursus): core message broker
- [tabellarius](https://github.com/cursus-io/tabellarius): dedicated CDC connector (first in our expanding toolkit)
